# Introduction:

For our final project of iOS app development\, we have build a music app named  __Rhythm\.__

We used storyboard and Swift to develop this application and for designing we build our wireframes in AdobeXD and exported using Zeplin\.

We are providing users premium version option to subscribe Rhythm Yearly or monthly\.

# Challenges:

The most biggest challenge was to figure out how we can implement Napster’s API and how we can play the tracks\.

We also had to learn how google\, facebook and firebase authentication works and how we can store data into firebase

For player\, we had to learn how we can implement the player track seeker\.

For Comments\, challenge was to store the comments for a particular song in firebase\.

# Next Steps:

In next step\, we can implement download track feature and share songs with others\.

In comment screen user can see other users profile\.

User can see the lyrics in now playing screen

User can make favorites and share with others\.

# Thank you!
