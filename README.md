# Rhythm
Music Streaming app

Introduction:

• For our final project of iOS app development, we have build a music app named

**Rhythm.**

• We used storyboard and Swift to develop this application and for designing we build

our wireframes in AdobeXD and exported using Zeplin.

• We have build this App using Napster API for tracks and all metadata about song

and playlists like top songs, albums, greatest hits, new releases etc.

Napster Documentation:

Authentication:

• In Rhythm, we are giving users 3

choices for sign in or register.

\1. Facebook Login

\2. Firebase Authentication

\3. Google Sign in





Sign up:

• For sign up, we have implemented

firebase sign up method, user can sign

up by email and password





Guides

• After logging in, user will see the 3

guide screens which was built using

Guide View Controller





Comments:

• In comments screen, user can comment

about that song and see others

comments as well, we are using

firebase realtime database for storing

comments.





Home Screen:

• After continuing guide screens, user will

go to home screen which is attached

with tab bar controller with all other

screens.

• In home screen, Top songs, biggest hits

and new releases. User can press more

and see the list of songs accordingly.





Now Playing:

• In Now playing screen, user will see the

nice animated album art and options for

shuffle, next song, previous song, play-

pause, and Comments button.





Explore Screen:

• In explore screen user will see

collection of genres and new albums

and releases.





Premium Subscription:

• We are providing users premium

version option to subscribe Rhythm

Yearly or monthly.





Challenges:

• The most biggest challenge was to figure out how we can implement Napster’s API

and how we can play the tracks.

• We also had to learn how google, facebook and firebase authentication works and

how we can store data into firebase

• For player, we had to learn how we can implement the player track seeker.

• For Comments, challenge was to store the comments for a particular song in

firebase.





Next Steps:

• In next step, we can implement download track feature and share songs with others.

• In comment screen user can see other users profile.

• User can see the lyrics in now playing screen

• User can make favorites and share with others.





Thank you!
